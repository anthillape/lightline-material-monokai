# lightline-material-monokai
A lightline theme based on material monokai

Influenced by `skielbasa/vim-material-monokai`

Theme features a very prominent insert mode and always colours both sides of the status line when it is active, so it is always clear which split is active and which mode you are in. The tab line is also styled so the active tab uses the background colour of the terminal, so it actually looks like a tab.

## Installation

Install using your fave plugin manager, eg with vim-plug:

`Plug 'anthillape/lightline-material-monokai'`

Activate in your vim config with

```
let g:lightline = {
  \ 'colorscheme': 'monokai_material'
	\ }
```
